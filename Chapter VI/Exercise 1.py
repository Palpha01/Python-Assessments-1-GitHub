# Exercise 1: Basic Math

# Using math module compute the following

# For a =2.3 find the ceil of a
# For a =2.3 find the floor of a
# For a = 5 find the factorial of a
# Find the value of 2^3
# For a=16 find the square root of a

import math

# 1: Ceil
a = 2.3
ceil = math.ceil(a)
print(ceil)

# 2: floor
floor = math.floor(a)
print(floor)

# 3: factorial
a = 5
factorial = math.factorial(a)
print(factorial)

# 4: Value
a = 2**3
print(a)

# 5: Squareroot
a = 16
sqrt = math.sqrt(a)
print(a)
